<h1 align="center">Follower Network
</h1>
<p align="center">Identified a non-obvious insight by gathering data from Twitter API & identifying centrality points using NetworkX
- Created a data frame to specify the node ID & node type to integrate into NetworkX’s categorical() method to apply a colormap of the network
- Coordinated a network graph using Gephi to visualize specific nodes factored by follower count
- Represented nodes as each Twitter account following @PlayValorant & edges with connections to each account
